title: Spectral Decompostion for XXZ
---

# Introduction

We introduce a formual for the spectral decomposition of the one-dimesional Heisnberg-Ising (XXZ) spin-1/2 chain. The formula is based on the Bethe Ansatz and contour integrals. In this project, we devoloped code to verify the spectral decompositon numerically and also develope simple, yet powerful, simulations of the XXZ spin chain. The goal is to develop state of the art simulations for two-dimensional quantum spin chains through an approximation methos.
