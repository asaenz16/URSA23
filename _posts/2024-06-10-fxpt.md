Let's discuss the *fixed point problem*. We aim to solve a system of equations using a fixed point method.

The Bethe equations are:

$$
\xi_i^L = (-1)^{N-1} \prod_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1 + \xi_i \xi_j - \Delta \xi_j}{1 + \xi_i \xi_j - \Delta \xi_i}, \quad i= 1, \dots, N 
$$

for $$N\leq L \in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 1}$$ and $$\Delta \in \mathbb{R}$$.

The idea was to defibe a sequence $$\xi(k) =(\xi_1(k), \dots, \xi_N(k))$$ as follows

$$
\xi_i(k+1)^L = (-1)^{N-1} \prod_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1 + \xi_i(k) \xi_j(k) - \Delta \xi_j(k)}{1 + \xi_i(k) \xi_j(k) - \Delta \xi_i(k)}, \quad i= 1, \dots, N 
$$

The problem is that we need to take an $$L^{th}$$ root and choose a branch cut. Then, to apply the *Fixed Point Theorem*, we need to make sure that our sequence is bounded away from the brach cut. This seems to be true in practice for $$\Delta$$ near $$0$$, but it seems to be fairly involved to prove that its true. In particular, it requires some bounds on $$\Delta$$, depending on $$N$$ and $$L$$, that are not trivial to optimize. I'm thinking of abandoning this approach.

I would like to consider an alternate sequence instead. First, note that we have

$$
\begin{align}
&(-1)^{N-1} \xi_i^L \prod_{j=1}^{N}(\xi_j^{-1} + \xi_i  - \Delta \xi_i\xi_j^{-1})\\
&= \prod_{j=1}^{N} ( \xi_i  - (\Delta- (\xi_j^{-1}) )\\
&= \sum_{m=0}^{N} (-1)^m e_{N-m}(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \xi_i^m
\end{align}
$$
