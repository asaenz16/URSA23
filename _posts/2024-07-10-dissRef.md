# Identity

I started plotting formulas from the previous [post](/URSA23/2024/07/09/dissN1.html) using Mathematica. It seems like I'm missing something. In particular, the integrals don't seem to converge when I compute them. 

[Here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0410102) is reference that seems to havde more details and clerify some of the computations.
